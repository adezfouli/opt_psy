#About

This repository provides the code for generating the graphs and deriving the equations in the following paper:

*Optimal response vigor and choice under non-stationary outcome values*
Dezfouli, A., Balleine, B.W. & Nock, R. Psychon Bull Rev (2018). https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-018-1500-3


#Code
The code folder contains three files:

* ``simulations.R`` This file contains the R code for generating
the plots in the paper.

* ``eq.py`` Some of the equations in the paper are derived using 
symbolic mathematics in Python using _sympy_ package. This file
contains the relevant code.

* ``roatational_solution.m`` Some of the symbolic mathematics
were not possible to carry our in Python, and they were performed 
using Matlab symbolic toolbox. These file contains the relevant
code.
